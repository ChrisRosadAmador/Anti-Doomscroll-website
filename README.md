<h1>Anti-doomscroll Website</h1>
<p>The Anti-Doomscroll Website is a project designed to help people break free from the cycle of "doomscrolling," which refers to endlessly consuming social media or news websites. Doomscrolling is common amongst students and some adults, preventing extended times of focus due to a lowered attention span from doomscrolling. 

The goal of the Anti-Doomscroll Website is to provide users with an overseer while they are working on whatever project they need to focus on. The website offers a Pomodoro timer that, along with the Chrome extension, will check to ensure the user is not on a blacklisted website. 

What is a blacklisted website? Well a website that is considered blacklisted will be chosen by the user, some common options include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Tiktok</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>any website that creates a distraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These sites can encourage procrastination, lower attention spans, and negatively impact mental health. While the website and extension can only block sites within Chrome, we hope it will serve as a gentle reminder to think twice before visiting distracting sites, even outside the browser.
